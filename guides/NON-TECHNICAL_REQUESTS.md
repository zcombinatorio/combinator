# Non-Technical Contribution Requests

Not a developer? You can still contribute to Z Combinator and earn $ZC tokens through non-technical work.

---

## How to Submit a Request

1. **Create a GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com).

2. **Go to the repository:** [https://github.com/zcombinatorio/zcombinator/](https://github.com/zcombinatorio/zcombinator/)

3. **In the top-right corner**, click the **Fork** menu and select **Create Fork**.

4. **Name your fork** (e.g., your Discord/X username) and wait for the fork to be created.

5. **Go to your GitHub profile** (top-right corner).

6. **In the top-left corner**, click the **Repositories** tab.

7. **Open the fork you just created.** The URL should look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/your-fork-name/zcombinator
   ```

8. **Next to the green Code button**, click **Add file → Create file**.

9. **Name your new file at the top** — this should be the **title or topic of your PR** (e.g., your idea or code contribution, one-two words).

10. **Open another browser tab** and go to: [https://github.com/zcombinatorio/zcombinator](https://github.com/zcombinatorio/zcombinator)

11. **Navigate to the folder** `github.io` labeled **PR templates**. Expand the left tree called **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE**.

12. **Copy the code from the template** that matches your PR type (work request, code contribution, or tweet request) into your new file in your fork tab.

13. **Edit and customize the template** as needed, then click **Commit changes**.

14. **Click Pull Request** to submit your PR for review by the ZCombinator team.

That's it. Your request will be reviewed and if approved, you'll be able to get paid in $ZC tokens through the same market-based governance system as code contributions.
