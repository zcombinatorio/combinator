## What Should Be Built?

1. Abstract

The ZC Staking Protocol is designed to encourage users to hold and stake $ZC for the long term while generating sustainable returns through fee-sharing, buyback, and flexible time-based rewards.

Its main objectives are to maintain token price stability, foster organic community marketing incentives, and provide a sustainable funding stream for the development team to continue expanding the ZC ecosystem.

2. Motivation

*Typical launchpad projects often face three key issues:

- Stakers withdraw immediately after the pre-sale, creating strong sell pressure.

- High APYs in early phases quickly decline, reducing staking interest.

- Developers lack financial resources during the initial building phase.


## Why Does This Matter?

*The ZC Staking Protocol addresses these problems through:

- A two-tier staking model (long-term & short-term).

- Real transaction fee-sharing within the ecosystem.

- Buyback and reinvested rewards post-unlock.

- Gamified staking (NFT booster, referral system, restake bonus) to maintain long-term engagement.


3. Staking Tiers & Reward Mechanism
🟩 Tier 1 – Long-term Staking (3–6 months)

Benefits:

- Earn 1.5x higher APY compared to short-term stakers, adjustable based on trading volume.

- Access to pre-sale rounds earlier and at a lower token price.

- Receive 2% of total fee volume from all tokens paired with $ZC across the ecosystem (distributed weekly).

- Time-weighted multiplier: the longer you stake, the higher your reward.

 Example: Reward = Stake × (1 + 0.1 × months_staked) × FeeShare



🟦 Tier 2 – Short-term Staking (1–2 months)

Benefits:

- Earn the standard APY (e.g., 90%).

- Join the pre-sale after the long-term staking round.

- Receive 2% fee rewards from tokens paired with $ZC during pre-sales.

- Restake immediately after maturity to gain a +5% APY bonus for the next cycle.


4. Lock & Buyback Mechanism

- After each pre-sale, tokens are locked for only 1 week.

- 50% of post-listing sell fees are used to buy back to support price stability.

- Buybacks are triggered only when token < SMA7 (7-day average price) for cost efficiency.

- During the first week post-listing (Guardian Week):

  + Trading fees (buy/sell) are doubled to discourage snipers & jeeters.

  + After 7 days, all fees automatically revert to normal.


5. Fee Distribution

     Time Period		            Recipient			                   Purpose

Week 1 after listing		      Dev team: 20%			                Funding for building & marketing
After week 1			            Dev team: 2%		      	          System maintenance fee
Always	Long-term stakers: 	  2% of total fee volume		        Fee-sharing rewards
Always	Short-term stakers: 	2% fee from pre-sale tokens	      Staking incentive


6. Gamification & Incentive Add-ons

🎖️ NFT Booster

Stakers can mint NFT badges (Bronze / Silver / Gold) based on staking duration:

- Bronze: +10% reward

- Silver: +20% reward

- Gold: +30% reward

NFTs are tradable or can be burned to transfer the reward multiplier to another wallet.


🔁 Restake Bonus

When a staking period ends, users who restake within 48 hours receive a +5% APY bonus for the next cycle.


👥 Referral Staking System

Referrers earn 2% bonus rewards from the referred user’s earnings (without deducting from them).
Referral links are displayed directly on the staking dashboard UI.


⚖️ Anti-Whale Mechanism

Rewards are calculated using a quadratic formula to prevent whales from dominating:

Reward = √(stake_amount) × fee_share × multiplier


🗳️ Governance (veZC Model)

- Long-term stakers receive veZC tokens (vote escrowed ZC), used to:

- Vote on buyback ratios.

- Decide which tokens to list next.

- Adjust fee reward allocation periodically.
