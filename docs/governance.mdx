description: 'How $ZC governance operates through futarchy and prediction markets'
---

## Overview

$ZC governance operates through futarchy, a decision-making framework where proposals are evaluated through prediction markets. The governance system is designed to maximize autonomy and verifiability while maintaining necessary oversight for operations requiring team execution.

**Core Principle:** Progressively decentralize by converting non-programmatic proposals into programmatic ones wherever possible.

## Governance Structure

### Programmatic Proposals

**Definition:** Proposals that can be executed permissionlessly, autonomously, and verifiably through smart contracts without human intervention.

**Process:** These proposals go directly to futarchy decision markets without requiring team sign-off.

**Eligible Actions:**

- **Emission Rate Changes**: Modifying $ZC token emission schedules
- **Emission Redirects**: Directing continuous emissions to specific addresses or purposes
- **ZC Token Operations**: Sending or selling $ZC emissions from protocol holdings
- **Treasury Asset Operations**: Sending or selling non-$ZC treasury assets
- **ZC LP Management**: Manipulating $ZC liquidity pool positions (e.g., migrating LP, rebalancing)

### Non-Programmatic Proposals

**Definition:** Proposals that require team execution, labor, or coordination and cannot be fully automated through smart contracts.

**Process:** These proposals require team sign-off before being submitted to futarchy decision markets.

**Examples:**
- Hosting AMAs or community events
- Creating marketing content or memes
- Building specific protocol features
- Fixing identified bugs
- Publishing roadmaps or strategic documentation
- Updating staking contract architecture
- Adjusting fee rates on $ZC projects
- Modifying market parameters (duration, thresholds, TWAP intervals)
- Managing LP positions in external projects (see below)

**Strategic Goal:** Continuously evaluate non-programmatic proposal types for conversion to programmatic execution where technically feasible.

## Decision Market Configuration

### Market Parameters

All futarchy decision markets currently operate with the following parameters:

- **Duration:** 24-hour voting period
- **Resolution Threshold:** 0.0% pass/fail gap
- **TWAP Calculation Interval:** 1 minute

**Note:** Market parameter changes are classified as non-programmatic proposals and require team approval.

### Decision Criteria

**Metric:** Price of $ZC token

Decision criteria is currently set by the ZC team.

## Current Protocol Emissions

**Daily:**
- 1,000,000 $ZC to development team

**Monthly:**
- 60,000,000 $ZC to staking contract

---

## External LP Custody

**Current Status:** $ZC currently has custody of LP positions from other projects.

**Governance Process:** Manipulation of external project LP is controlled via decision markets but classified as **non-programmatic**. These proposals require:
1. Team approval
2. Relevant project approval/sign-off
3. Submission to futarchy decision markets

This structure ensures collaborative management of partnered assets while maintaining governance oversight.
