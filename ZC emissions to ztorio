# Work Request

We request the creation of a **continuous ZC token emission stream allocated to the Ztorio project.
These emissions will be used to reward contributors, incentivize onboarding new developers, and fund ZC-aligned build activity happening inside the Ztorio coordination layer.

This is an ongoing structured mechanism tied to measurable ecosystem growth.


## What Should Be Built?

1. Establish a ZC → Ztorio emissions allocation
2. Ztorio will operate an engine that distributes ZC to:
   - Bounty hunters bringing new high-quality devs into ZC
   - Builders making code contributions / PRs across ZC ecosystem repos in ztorio area
   - Community rewards
   - Fund ztorio build activities


## Why Does This Matter?

Impact on the project:
- Converts Ztorio into an active coordination layer that systematically pulls talent/new devs into ZC.
- Aligns memetic energy with production energy.
- Reduces onboarding friction and turns community “hype” into actual effort.

**Who benefits:**
- ZC protocol (more contributors & faster iteration)
- New devs (clear path + incentives)
- Ztorio holders (memetic power gains purpose)
- The ecosystem (network effect of builders onboarding builders)


## Expected outcome:

- Continuous inflow of new developers into ZC via Ztorio bounty network.
- Measurable increase in PRs, code review activity, and shipped features.

## Supporting Evidence


- Ztorio manually onboarding —> emissions allow scaling

**Note:** When decision markets (Percent Markets) go live, they can be plugged directly into this flow to govern emissions distribution.
