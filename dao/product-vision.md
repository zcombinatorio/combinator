# Product Vision

## Vision

### Long-term Vision for the Company
- Every future organization becomes a futarchic organization.
- We want to reduce the friction associated with using crypto to 0.
- We want to:
  - Solve deep problems
  - Expand the market
  - Finance R&D for problem discovery and resolution

### What We Want to Change or Solve
- We want to significantly shift the overton window on futarchy.
- **Why?** In order to trustlessly align incentives such that novel organizations are easier to build

### Product Strategy
- **Continuously improving product** through a series of iterations

### Market Expansion
- Make it easy to use our product
- Push and continue solving the deepest problems facing token network developers

### Behavior Changes Needed

#### High "skin in the game" participants
- Need to launch decision markets

#### DM traders
- Need to speculate on decision markets

#### Spot traders
- Need to bid projects using our mechanisms

## Future Vision

### 3 Years
- Crypto pivots from static memecoins
- Teams are genuinely able to raise money for on-chain projects that govern via futarchy
- Decision markets is considered extremely hype
- People start building new token networks (using futarchy) previously not possible
- New manipulation & attack vectors are unveiled

### 5 Years
- Golden age of crypto projects
- Non-crypto native serial developers / project builders consider crypto as a necessity for interesting projects
- Crypto's poor reputation has receded

## Strategy Narrative

Crypto is stuck. Misaligned incentives between builders, contributors, investors, and customers result in few viable crypto products, upset communities, private rounds, bundling, and low product adoption. The lack of market based governance over token networks is preventing crypto from evolving into new use cases.

We want to bring decision markets to all builders. We're pioneering futarchy powered tokens that govern themselves. Instead of private rounds that incentivize exit scamming retail or on-chain token launches that struggle to bootstrap into products, futarchic tokens are launched early and evolve with community needs.

## Long Term Product Strategy

### Network Effects
**Yes**
- As you get counterparties that care more about your protocol, the markets become more efficient and they can help you bootstrap easier
- Legitimacy infrastructure

### Pricing Model
**No** - it's highly reflexive

### Customer Lock-in/High Switching Costs
**Medium**
- Entire governance structures are baked into our product. Results in massive reduction of token holder trust to migrate.

### High Gross Margins
**Extremely**

### Organic Demand vs Marketing Spend
- We suspect marketing spend can be resolved by smart direction of token emissions to growth loops
