Staking length & rewards -

Duration proposed - 7, 14 & 28 days

Hypothetically, 
If I stake for 7 days, I get 100 $ZC

if staked for 14 days, 250 $ZC (25% more than 7days)

if staked for 28 days, 650 $ZC (62.5% more than 7 days & 30% more than 14 days)

This way we won’t have one single day in a month where everyone is afraid of unlocks & dump & also rewards people who stake for longer. 

28 days can also be 30days, whatever the team finds efficient to calculate & code.
