# Work Request

**Note**: Use this for work requiring team access (permissioned protocol access, migrations, fee changes, etc.). If you're submitting code yourself, use "Code Contribution" instead.

## What Should Be Built

1. Remove liquidity from the current ZTORIO/SOL pool.
2. Create a new liquidity pool for ZTORIO/ZC.
3. Re-deploy the liquidity into the ZTORIO/ZC pool.
4. If required, distribute migration compensation (airdrop or equivalent) to ensure holders remain unaffected.


## Why Does This Matter?

**Impact on the project:**

Strengthens ZC as the base coordination asset

Gives Ztorio a clearer role as cultural + narrative liquidity

Creates a self-reinforcing internal market loop
**Who benefits:**
ztorio and zc

**Expected outcome:**
Seamless migration with no action required from holders.
